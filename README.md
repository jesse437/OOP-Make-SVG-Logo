### Creating an SVG-LOGO has never been this easy. Using OOP language, you can now create an SVG-LOGO by answering just a few questions.

# 2. User Story

```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```

# 3. How to use

### With Object Oriented Programming we start the website from the terminal using the Node command followed by the server.js file name to begin our application. Then you will be prompted to answer a few questions. When finished you will see the logo file appear on the images folder. To see the image just open the HTML file live.
